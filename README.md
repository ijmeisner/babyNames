# Derby Horses
A Java Swing application showing the relationship between KY Derby prep races and the winning KY Derby Horse. Created for CSC 420 Programming Languages course at Georgetown College, taught by Dorian Yeager.

The [KY Derby Prep Races](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3j7Y8pq_tXJMt_YU-nel9PZY1Jrwell_YsF2bp8D6Y/pub#) data set found from [Horse Racing Datasets](http://horseracingdatasets.com/).
